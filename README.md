Triple Ten Sprint 4 Project 

Vehicle Explorer Web Application
Vehicle Explorer is an interactive web tool designed to simulate random data exploration and visualization for vehicle statistics. It allows users to explore and analyze vehicle data by applying filters, generating random subsets, and visualizing key metrics like price distributions, brand comparisons, and paint color distributions. The app utilizes Streamlit for the interface, with additional support from libraries like Pandas and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

Project Description
The Vehicle Explorer application is built to simulate the exploration of random events by working with a preloaded dataset of vehicles. This dataset includes details about vehicle prices, models, brands, transmission types, odometers, and more. Users can filter data by year and manufacturer to dynamically generate insights and visualize various aspects of the dataset.

Key Features:
Filter vehicle data based on year and brand.
Explore price distributions using histograms and scatter plots.
Compare price distributions between two selected brands.
View paint color distribution for different manufacturers.
Download filtered data as a CSV file for offline use.
Libraries and Tools Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
Base64: For enabling CSV downloads.
